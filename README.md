# EmissionLineAnalysis 
EmissionLineAnalysis is a powerful Python code to perform spectral emission line fits with multiple gaussian components in echelle or long-slit data. 
The fitting procedure is based around the code lmfit, https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/.

Currently this project was designed for the analysis of the internal kinematics of star forming regions using MIKE echelle spectrograph data of Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. However, it can be used to model any emission lines in echelle or long-slit spectroscopy.
