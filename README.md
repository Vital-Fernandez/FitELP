# EmissionLineAnalysis
Fit emission profiles with multiple gaussian components. Takes echelle data as an input

Currently this project was designed for the analysis of the internal kinematics of giant star forming regions in interacting galaxies. Data is from the MIKE spectrograph.
However, it can be used to model any emission lines in echelle spectra.
