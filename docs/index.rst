EmissionLineAnalysis
====================
Fit emission profiles with multiple gaussian components. Takes echelle or long slit data as an input.
The fitting procedure is based around the code lmfit, https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/.

Currently this project was designed for the analysis of the internal kinematics of giant star forming regions in
interacting galaxies. Data is from the MIKE spectrograph. However, it can be used to model any emission lines in
echelle or long slit spectroscopy.

The code is currently still in development, and there may be many issues present. Contact the authors for assistance.
